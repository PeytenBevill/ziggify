# Ziggify: Inventory Management System

Welcome to Ziggify, my personal approach to inventory management. Ziggify can do all your basic crud operations: add new inventory and vendors, update that same information, and delete that same information. Ziggify app also allows your employees to scan a barcode to add new shipments instantly from their iPhone or Android! That's right, live inventory updating! My next steps would be to create a POS website that interacts with Ziggify's dashboard and reports.

## Features
